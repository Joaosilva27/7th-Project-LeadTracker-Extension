# 7th-Project-LeadTracker-Extension
A simple yet useful chrome extension to track and save URLs.
This was the first ever chrome extension that I built, I used HTML, CSS & Javascript.
It's extremely useful for hiring managers to keep every interesting Linked in profile saved for example.

It has three buttons: "SAVE INPUT", "SAVE TAB" and "DELETE ALL".
The "save input" button saves the url that the user copied and pasted into the input bar.
The "save tab" button saves the url from the website where the user is currently on.
The "delete all" button deletes all of the urls saved on the list.
